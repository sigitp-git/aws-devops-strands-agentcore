Temperature Scale
•	Range: Typically 0.0 to 1.0 (some models support higher values)
•	Default: Usually around 0.7
How Temperature Works
Low Temperature (0.0 - 0.3):
•	More deterministic and predictable responses
•	Less creative but more focused and consistent
•	Better for: Factual questions, code generation, structured tasks
•	Example: Always gives the same answer to "What is 2+2?"
Medium Temperature (0.4 - 0.7):
•	Balanced between creativity and consistency
•	Good for: General conversations, explanations, most use cases
•	Default choice for most applications
High Temperature (0.8 - 1.0+):
•	More creative and varied responses
•	Less predictable but more diverse
•	Better for: Creative writing, brainstorming, generating multiple ideas
•	Risk: May produce less accurate or coherent responses
In Your Bedrock Model
Looking at your current agent, you can set temperature like this:
# Create a Bedrock model instance with temperature
model = BedrockModel(
    model_id='us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0',
    temperature=0.7  # Adjust this value
)
Practical Examples
Temperature 0.1 (Very focused):
•	"The AWS Well-Architected Framework has 6 pillars: Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, and Sustainability."
Temperature 0.9 (More creative):
•	"The AWS Well-Architected Framework is like a compass for cloud architects, guiding them through six essential pillars that form the foundation of robust cloud solutions..."
For Your AWS DevOps Bot
Since your bot provides technical AWS information, you might want:
•	Temperature 0.3-0.5: For accurate, consistent technical answers
•	Temperature 0.6-0.8: For more engaging, conversational responses while maintaining accuracy

Benefits of Temperature 0.3 for Your AWS DevOps Bot:
1.	Consistent Structure - The response follows a clear, organized format every time
2.	Technical Accuracy - Focuses on providing accurate AWS service information
3.	Professional Tone - Maintains a professional, helpful tone suitable for technical guidance
4.	Reliable Information - Less likely to generate inconsistent or inaccurate technical details

How to Adjust Temperature for Different Use Cases:
You can easily modify the temperature in your code:
# For very focused, deterministic responses (good for code examples, exact procedures)
temperature=0.1

# For balanced technical responses (current setting - recommended)
temperature=0.3

# For more conversational, engaging responses
temperature=0.5

# For creative brainstorming or varied explanations
temperature=0.7

Your Current Configuration:
model = BedrockModel(
    model_id='us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0', 
    temperature=0.3  # Perfect for technical AWS DevOps guidance
)

The temperature=0.3 setting is ideal for your AWS DevOps bot because it provides:
•	Reliable technical information
•	Consistent formatting and structure
•	Professional, helpful responses
•	Accurate AWS service details
Your bot is now optimized for providing consistent, accurate AWS DevOps guidance while maintaining an engaging conversational style!
